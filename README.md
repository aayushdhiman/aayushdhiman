## üí´ Hello there!

My name is Aayush Dhiman. I'm a 21 year old full stack software engineer. Currently, I am a Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence student at Northeastern University. 
I'm passionate about a marriage between software engineering and cybersecurity, especially using my skills in software development and machine learning engineering to create solutions to cybersecurity problems.
I've previously/most recently developed using Django, Python, React, and Typescript (not featured on this GitHub).
You can also find me at [https://www.gitlab.com/aayushdhiman.](https://gitlab.com/aayushdhiman)
Recently, I've been participating in CTFs and building plugins for specific file types to use in Ghidra (which will hopefully be open-sourced, soon).
If you want to reach me, please contact me via email or on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aayushdhiman/.
